# Linear-Regression

## About

The Wisconsin State Climatology Office keeps a record of the number of days each year that Lake Mendota was covered by ice (https://climatology.nelson.wisc.edu/first-order-station-climate-data/madison-climate/lake-ice/history-of-ice-freezing-and-thawing-on-lake-mendota/).

I used the dataset to run linear regression and predict the number of ice days in future years.
